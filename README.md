# Project: Landing Page

This my sumbission for The Odin Project(TOP) Fundamentals Landing Page Project.
TOP gave a web page design image and some details about fonts and colours used. I need to re-create it from scratch using the skills I have learned so far in the course; basic HTML and CSS. TOP recommened to make use of FLEX for the layout. They also encourage you to embelish the content a little and use actual images in the img sections.
